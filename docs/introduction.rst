Cryptogram Solver
=================

Introduction
------------
Cryptogram Solver is a program to assist in the solution of cryptogram puzzles.

Once a user has logged in, a process used solely to keep track of that user's
completed puzzles, he or she can select a puzzle collection and a puzzle to
solve within that collection.  Using the mouse, or the arrow keys, a letter
from the puzzle can be selected and then, using the keyboard or the mouse on
the on-screen keyboard, a possible solution letter is selected.  The program
automatically fills that letter in for all the instances of the code letter that
appear in the puzzle.

When the user completes a puzzle he or she can click the "Check Solution" button,
or its entry in the Puzzle menu.  If a solution is available, the user will be told
whether their solution matches the stored solution.  If there is not yet a solution
available the user will be asked if they want to save their solution.  If the user
is an administrator he or she can save the solution to Cryptogram Solver's puzzle
collection files.
