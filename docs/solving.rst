Solving Puzzles with Cryptogram Solver
======================================

The basic idea is to use the interface to select code letters and try possible solution letters.  Code letters are
selected by clicking on them with the left mouse button or by using the keyboard arrow keys to move the red
highlight box from one position to the next.  When a code letter is selected all positions with the same letter will
be highlighted with a green tint.  You suggest a possible solution letter for that code letter by clicking a "key" on
the virtual keyboard below the puzzle area, or by typing that key on the real keyboard.  That letter is inserted in all
of the corresponding solution boxes at once.  If you use a letter that is already being used a warning box appears to
make sure you want to change it.
