General Hints for Solving Cryptograms
=====================================

Cryptogram puzzles can seem frustrating at first. There seem to be so many possibilities that finding the correct
solution may seem impossible. Your task can be simplified by keeping the following things in mind:

#. Look for single character words. They will be either "I" or "A".

#. Two letter words always include a vowel. Words like "AN", "AS", "AT", "BE", "HE", "IF", "IN", "IS", "IT", "ME", "TO", and "WE" are frequently used.

#. Frequent use of the same pattern of letters in a three-letter word may be a sign of the word "THE".

#. Keep in mind that English words often end in "ANT", "ED", "ENT", "ING", and "TION".

#. The apostrophe is often followed either by the letter "T", as in a contraction (DON'T, WON'T, etc.) or the letter "S", as in a possessive, such as when speaking of "the MOON'S orbit."

#. If a sentence ends with a question mark ("?"), the sentence will probably begin with a question word such as "WHO", "WHAT", "WHEN", "WHERE", "HOW" or "WHY".

Oftentimes, using Cryptogram Solver, you can just make seemingly random guesses and, suddenly, a word will pop out at
you and suggest other words around it.  A puzzle that seemed impossible to solve then unravels a short time afterwards.

If you get really stuck, and there are hints available for the puzzle, the :doc:`Hint <hintfeature>` feature will give
you some of the letters used in the puzzle.
